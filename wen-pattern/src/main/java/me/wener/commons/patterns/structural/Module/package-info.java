/**
 * In software engineering, the module pattern is a design pattern used to
 * implement the concept of software modules, defined by modular programming,
 * in a programming language that does not or only partially supports it.

 * There are several ways to implement this pattern, depending on the host
 * programming language, such as the singleton design pattern, object-oriented
 * static members in a class, and procedural global functions.
 *
 * 定义
 * The module software design pattern provides the features and syntactic structure
 * defined by the modular programming paradigm to programming languages that do not
 * support it or support it only partially.
